# A Music Player using Python



A feature-rich music player built with Python's Tkinter and Pygame libraries. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate GUI design with audio playback functionalities, including playlist management, play/pause, stop, and navigation controls (next/previous). It showcases real-time song selection and playback using efficient file handling and pattern matching. With a sleek black-themed interface and custom icons, this player brings style and functionality to the user experience. A practical example of combining creativity with programming precision.
